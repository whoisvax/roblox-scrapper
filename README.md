# Roblox Scrapper.
Searches the Roblox marketplace, parses the binary and looks for certain keywords inside.

## **Usage:**
- __1. Searches the Roblox creator marketplace.__
- __2. Filters Results.__
- __3. Parses the binary blob of scraped objects for certain keywords.__
- __4. If keywords match, sends download URL for the object to a Discord webhook__

## **Limitations:**
- __Roblox search APIs are limited to only 25-40 pages of 42 results.__
- __Hitting a rate-limit makes the program skip the object it orignially was going to parse.__
- __The filtering is unoptimised.__
- __It only searches within the UTF-8 text of the binary of an object (more convenient would be converting to XML (RBXLX or RBXMX)__
